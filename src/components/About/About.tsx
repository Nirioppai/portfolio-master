          <Typography paragraph>
            Back in 2018, I was given the opportunity to lead a web development
            project for Xavier School San Juan as a student, creating their
            first queueing system for student enrollments. The system was
            well-received by staff, students, and parents. Reflecting on that
            experience, it marked the beginning of a deep dive into coding and
            web development. Fast forward to today, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of
            developing an additional system for Xavier School, building systems
            for a startup, and engaging in various freelance opportunities.
            Currently, I am exploring the field of Automation Testing.

            My primary focus these days is designing automated test cases and
            implementing the AGILE workflow for the development team at DOST -
            PHIVOLCS. I particularly enjoy working at the intersection of design
            and engineering, where aesthetics meet robust construction. In my
            free time, I continually expand my knowledge in the field of quality
            assurance.
