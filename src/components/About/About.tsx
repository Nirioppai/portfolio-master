    <Typography paragraph>
      Back in 2018, I was given the opportunity to lead a web
      development project for Xavier School San Juan as a student,
      creating their first queueing system for student enrollments.
      The system was well-received by staff, students, and parents.
      Reflecting on that experience, it marked the beginning of a
      deep dive into coding and web development. Fast forward to
      today, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of developing an additional
      system for Xavier School, building systems for a startup, and
      engaging in various freelance opportunities. Currently, I am
      exploring the field of Automation Testing.

      My primary focus these days is designing automated test cases
      and implementing the AGILE workflow for the development team
      at DOST - PHIVOLCS. I particularly enjoy working at the
      intersection of design and engineering, where aesthetics meet
      robust construction. In my free time, I continually expand my
      knowledge in the field of quality assurance.
